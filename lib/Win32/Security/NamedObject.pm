=head1 NAME

C<Win32::Security::NamedObject> - Security manipulation for named objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Win32::Security::NamedObject;

	my $noFoo = Win32::Security::NamedObject->('FILE', "C:\\Foo\\foo.txt");
	my $dacl = $noFoo->dacl();
	print $dacl->dump();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provide an object-oriented interface for manipulating security 
information on named objects (i.e. files, registry keys, etc.).  Note that, like 
the rest of C<Win32::Security>, it currently only provides support for files.  
It has been architected to eventually support all object types supported by the 
C<GetNamedSecurityInfo> Win32 API call.  Also, it currently only supports access 
to the DACL and Owner information - SACL access will come later.

=head2 Installation instructions

This installs as part of C<Win32::Security>.

To install via MakeMaker, it's the usual procedure - download from CPAN, 
extract, type "perl Makefile.PL", "nmake", then "nmake test", then "nmake 
install".  See C<TESTING> for more information about enabling the more extensive 
test suite.

It depends upon the other C<Win32::Security> modules.  The suite of 
C<Win32::Security> modules depends upon:

=over 4

=item C<Class::Prototyped> 0.98 or later

Support for prototype-based programming in Perl.  C<Win32::Security::ACE> uses 
this to programmatically generate large number of classes that use 
multiple-inheritance.  C<Win32::Security::ACL> and 
C<Win32::Security::NamedObject> use this to support programmatic generation of 
classes that interact with the C<Win32::Security::ACE> classes.  
C<Win32::Security::Recursor> uses this to allow for flexible behavior 
modification (since C<Win32::Security::Recursor> objects are really behavioral, 
not stateful).

=item C<Data::BitMask> 0.13 or later

Flexible support for manipulating masks and constants.

=item C<Win32::API>

Support for making arbitrary Win32 API calls from Perl.  There is no C code 
anywhere in C<Win32::Security>.  C<Win32::API> is why.

=back

All of the above modules should be available on CPAN, and also via PPM.

=head1 C<Win32::Security> MODULES

=head2 C<Win32::Security::SID>

C<Win32::Security::SID> provides a set of functions for doing SID manipulation 
(binary to text and vice-versa) as well as wrappers around 
C<Win32::LookupAccountName> and C<Win32::LookupAccountSID> that make them 
friendlier.

=head2 C<Win32::Security::Raw>

C<Win32::Security::Raw> provides a number of function wrappers around a number 
of Win32 API calls.  Each wrapper wraps around a single Win32 API call and 
provides rudimentary data structure marshalling and parsing.  This is the only 
module that uses C<Win32::API> to make API calls - all of the other modules 
make their API calls through the wrappers provided by this module.

=head2 C<Win32::Security::ACE>

C<Win32::Security::ACE> provides an object-oriented interface for parsing, 
creating, and manipulating Access Control Entries (ACEs).

=head2 C<Win32::Security::ACL>

C<Win32::Security::ACE> provides an object-oriented interface for manipulating 
Access Control Lists (ACLs).

=head2 C<Win32::Security::NamedObject>

C<Win32::Security::NamedObject> provides support for accessing and modifying the 
security information attached to Named Objects.

=head2 C<Win32::Security::Recursor>

C<Win32::Security::Recursor> provides support for recursing through trees of 
Named Objects and inspecting and/or modifying the security settings for those 
objects.


=head1 C<Win32::Security> SCRIPTS

Provided for your amusement and use are a few scripts that make use of the above 
modules.  These scripts were the raison d'etre for the modules, and so it seemed 
justifiable to ship them with it.  The scripts were located in the 
C<lib\Win32\Security> directory so that they will be automatically installed as 
part of the package when deployed via PPM.  The scripts have documentation (use 
the C<-h> option), but here is a quick overview of them so that you don't 
overlook them.

=head2 C<PermDump.pl>

This utility dumps permissions on files.  It supports distinguishing between 
inherited and explicit permissions along with determining when there are 
problems with inherited permissions.  It has a number of options, and it's 
designed to output in either TDF or CSV format for easy parsing and viewing.

I would personally strongly recommend that all system administrators set up a 
nightly task to dump all the permissions on server volumes to a text file.  This 
makes it easy to recover should you make a mistake while doing permissions 
manipulation, and it also gives you a searchable file for looking for 
permissions without waiting for the script to dump permissions.  While the 
script is very fast and generally scans several hundred files per second, if you 
have a volume with hundreds of thousands of files, it can still take a while to 
run.

=head2 C<PermFix.pl>

B<WARNING>: This utility is in beta.  It has B<not> undergone extensive testing 
yet, and the test suite for this script is still under development.  I strongly 
encourage users to use C<PermDump.pl> to take a snapshot of the existing 
permissions before using this script in case there are problems, and to examine 
the resulting permissions closely for signs of error.

This utility is designed to do one simple task: fix problems with inherited 
permissions resulting from files and/or folders being moved between two folders 
on the same volume that have differing inheritable permissions.

=head2 C<PermChg.pl>

B<WARNING>: This utility is in beta.  It has B<not> undergone extensive testing 
yet, and the test suite for this script is still under development.  I strongly 
encourage users to use C<PermDump.pl> to take a snapshot of the existing 
permissions before using this script in case there are problems, and to examine 
the resulting permissions closely for signs of error.

B<NOTES>: The owner modification support in the script is not yet finished.  
Also, the C<-file> option has not had very extensive testing.

This utility is the counterpart to C<PermDump.pl>.  It allows you to change the 
permissions.  Unlike C<X?CACLS.EXE>, this utility properly understands and 
interacts with inherited permissions.  It supports two modes for specifying 
permissions.  The first allows you to specify permissions using the command line 
much like C<X?CACLS.EXE>.  The second allows you to pass the permissions in a 
text file using the same format as is outputted by C<PermDump.pl>.

Say you get a call from an executive insisting that Jane be given access to 
everything that John has access to.  The first step is to make Jane a member of 
all of the groups that John is in, but that doesn't address explicitly assigned 
permissions.  To deal with that, dump all the permissions on the volume using 
C<PermDump.pl>.  Open the file up in Excel and sort on the Trustee.  Copy the 
lines for John into another spreadsheet and replace the Trustee name with 
Jane's.  Then pass that into C<PermChg.pl> with the C<-file> option and you're 
done!

=head1 TESTING

For a set of modules like Win32::Security that are intended to interact with 
permissions, the only way to really test them is to have them interact with real 
permissions.  Unfortunately, the only viable to do that is to modify a live 
filesystem and see what happens.  However, I felt uncomfortable running such 
tests as part of a default test suite, so I have disabled them by default.

The tests in question are in the C<t\extended.t> and C<t\scripts.t> files.  
They create a single directory in C<%TEMP%> named C<Win32-Security_TestDir_$$> 
(where C<$$> is the process ID>.  They create directories and files in that test 
directory and apply permissions to them.  The tests require C<CACLS.EXE> (which 
should be present on all Windows 2000/XP/2003 installs) and that a usable 
version of C<perl.exe> be in the path.

The tests take a while to run (five minutes on my 1.8 GHz machine) because they 
are very extensive (7500+ tests in C<extended.t> alone), but I strongly urge you 
to consider running them and reporting any errors.

To enable them, open C<t\extended.t> and C<t\scripts.t> and change line 11 in 
each to read "C<< $enabled = 1; >>".  I strongly encourage testing using every 
OS you plan to use the modules with, and using both privileged and 
non-privileged accounts.

=head1 ARCHITECTURE

C<Win32::Security::NamedObject> uses the same class architecture as 
C<Win32::Security::ACL>.  Unlike C<Win32::Security::ACE> and 
C<Win32::Security::ACL>, it B<doesn't> use the flyweight design pattern.  (For 
obvious reasons - you're unlikely to create multiple 
C<Win32::Security::NamedObject> objects for the same thing!)

=head1 Method Reference

=head2 C<new>

This creates a new C<Win32::Security::NamedObject> object.

The various calling forms are:

=over 4

=item * C<< Win32::Security::NamedObject->new($objectType, $objectName) >>

=item * C<< "Win32::Security::NamedObject::$objectType"->new($objectName) >>

=back

Note that when using C<$objectType> in the package name, the value needs to be 
canonicalized (i.e. C<SE_FILE_OBJECT>, not the shortcut C<FILE>).  If the 
C<$objectType> has already been canonicalized, improved performance can be 
realized by making the call on the fully-qualified package name and thus 
avoiding the call to redo the canonicalization.  Aliases are permitted when 
C<$objectName> is passed as a parameter.

The currently permitted objectName formats (text copied from 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/security/security/se_object_type.asp
) are:

=over 4

=item C<SE_FILE_OBJECT>

Indicates a file or directory. The name string that identifies a file or 
directory object can be:

=over 4

=item * 

A relative path, such as C<"abc.dat"> or C<"..\\abc.dat">

=item *

An absolute path, such as C<"\\abc.dat">, C<"c:\\dir1\\abc.dat">, or 
C<"g:\\remote_dir\\abc.dat">

=item *

A UNC name, such as C<"\\\\computer_name\\share_name\\abc.dat">

=item *

A local file system root, such as C<"\\\\\\\\.\\\\c:">. Security set on a file 
system root does not persist when the system is restarted

=back

=item C<SE_REGISTRY_KEY>

Indicates a registry key. A registry key object can be in the local registry, 
such as C<"CLASSES_ROOT\\some_path">; or in a remote registry, such as 
C<"\\\\computer_name\\CLASSES_ROOT\\some_path">. The names of registry keys must 
use the following literal strings to identify the predefined registry keys: 
C<"CLASSES_ROOT">, C<"CURRENT_USER">, C<"MACHINE">, and C<"USERS">.

In addition, the following literal strings will be mapped to the legal literals:

=over 4

=item *

C<HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT> -> C<CLASSES_ROOT>

=item *

C<HKEY_CURRENT_USER> -> C<CURRENT_USER>

=item *

C<HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE> -> C<MACHINE>

=item *

C<HKEY_USERS> -> C<USERS>

=head2 C<dacl>

Gets or sets the DACL for the object.  If no parameters are passed, it reads the 
DACL for the object and returns a C<Win32::Security::ACL> class object.  To set 
the DACL, pass the desired C<Win32::Security::ACL> for the object and an 
optional C<SECURITY_INFORMATION> mask for specifying the bits 
C<UNPROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION> or 
C<PROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION>.  If the 
C<UNPROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION> is set, then permissions are inherited.  
If C<PROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION> is set, then permissions are NOT 
inherited (i.e. inheritance is blocked).  If neither is set, then the existing 
setting is maintained.

Be forewarned that when setting the DACL, under Windows 2000 and more recent 
OSes, the call to C<SetNamedSecurityInfo> results in the automatic propagation 
of inheritable ACEs to existing child objects (see 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/security/securi 
ty/setnamedsecurityinfo.asp for more information).  This does B<not> happen 
under Windows NT, and if you need propagation of inheritable permissions under 
Windows NT, you need to write your own code to implement that.  Under OSes that 
support automatic propagation, the call to set a DACL can take a very long time 
to return if there are a lot of child objects!  Finally, any errors in the 
inherited DACLs buried in the tree will be automatically fixed by this call, 
constrained by the privileges of the account executing the code.

When setting the DACL under Windows 2000 and more recent OSes, if 
C<UNPROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION> is specified, or if the 
C<SECURITY_INFORMATION> mask is unspecified and the object is currently 
inheriting permissions, then any ACEs in the passed DACL that have the 
C<INHERITED_ACE> bit set in C<aceFlags> are automatically ignored.  The OS will 
automatically propagate the inheritable ACEs and will only explicitly set those 
ACEs in the passed DACL that do not have the C<INHERITED_ACE> bit set in 
C<aceFlags>.

If C<PROTECTED_DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION> is specified, or if the 
C<SECURITY_INFORMATION> mask is unspecified and the object is currently blocking 
inherited permissions, than the C<INHERITED_ACE> bit in C<aceFlags> for all ACEs 
in the passed DACL is automatically cleared.  That is to say, all passed ACEs 
are treated as explicit, independent of the C<INHERITED_ACE> bit in C<aceFlags>.
